    <h2>Shifter Upgrade</h2>
    <p>I made this upgrade to improve the shifterlook as well as the feel and look to mimic a gearbox mounted shifter 
      lever feel as the MR2 uses shifter cables. I purchased the 5-in-1 MR2Heaven Short-throw shifter with a drop
      plate. The short shifter has a higher mounting position for the shifter cables meaning the lever has to move
      less to complete the shift. It also makes shifting feel slightly heavier as it requires more force to apply the
      same torque with less distance. I also added a OEM style shifter knob with green stitching (to match the car colour).
      The knob is weighted to also improve the feel. I also purchased a Halo Shifter Surround kit to with an alcantara shifter
      boot to replace the big worn leather shifter boot. It givs it a nice and clean OEM+ look.
    </p>
    <p>Installing the short shifter was quite easy. I had to remove the large center panel by removing 4 screws with caps.
      The radio fascia had to be sligtly elevated from the bottom to remove two additional screws. Then I unthreaded the old 
      shifter knob, unclipped the plastic shifter surrownd and finally removed the panel.
    </p>
    <p>Then I had detach the shifter cables from the lever. I left these attached to the shifter mounting plate. The mounting
      plate is attached to the chassis via 4 bolts with the head on top. The shifter lever was attached to the mounting plate
      via another 4 bolts with nuts at the bottom. I recommend loosening these before removing the mounting plate. 
    </p>
    <p>The lever sits in an plastic cup and ha an arm connected to a spring mechanism held by a small cup. I used this small
      cup for th new lever since the new one was too loose, resulting a lot of play. However, I 3D printed a new shifter cup
      using PLA. Someone kindly designed and shared the CAD file 
      <a href="http://www.mr2.com/forums/threads/112626-Shift-Lever-Seat-Cup">here</a>
      . I used Nulon grease with PTFE on both cups and inserted the new shifter lever. Reassembly was the same procedure as 
      disassembly.
    </p>
    <h2>Gas Strut Kit</h2>
    <p>I purchased a gas strut kit for the engine bay lid and frunk from MR2Heaven. These are a great way to modernise
      your car. No more need for an old slightly bent metal rod to prop up your frunk lid.
    </p>
    <h2>Air Induction Kit</h2>
    <p>This was my first engine bay mod. I was researching ways to make the car sound better without drone and
      excess volume and found the perfect solution. A youtuber called GeekoftheRoad owns an MR2 and made an instructional
      video on how to make an Air Induction Kit for an NA MR2 SW20. The result would be something that's loud only when the
      throttle is open wide and at the higher RPM range and is quiet otherwise. The induction roar at WOT is phenomenal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hardest part of this mod was removing the old intake. This included several parts including resonator boxes,
      the old panel airfilter mount and the hoses and sensor mounts.
