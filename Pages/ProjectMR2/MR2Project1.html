    <p>This was one of the first mods I made to this car, as I am a audio fanatic. When I purchased the car, the the door speakers and one 
      tweeter were blown, causing sound distortion. The rear speakers were replaced by the previous owner with Kicker speakers, but as they 
      are small 3 1/2 inch speakers driven by the stock radio, they were insuffucuent to power the car. In this page, I will rundown the
      design process, the parts I used and the installation.
    </p>
    <h2>Design Process</h2>
    <p>My requirements for the sound system was to have:
      <ul>
        <li>Balanced and clear audio throughout audible frequency range</li>
        <li>Require minimal modification to maintain stock look</li>
        <li>Use the stock head unit</li>
        <li>Have AUX and/or Buetooth functionality</li>
       </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Speakers</h3>
    <p>
       The first step was to determine all the speaker positions and sizes. I found a 
       <a href="https://www.mr2oc.com/threads/stock-speaker-sizes-locations-pin-outs-and-harness-p-ns.180/">forum</a>
       which stated that the front door speakers were 5 1/4 inch but could fit some 6 1/2 inch speakers and the rear speakers were 3 1/2 inch. 
       The doors also have tweeters mounted on close to the side-view mirrors.
    </p>
    <p>
      I decided to purchase Infinity Reference 5030CX speakers for the door speakers. These are produced by Harmon Kardon which have a good reputation for car speakers.
      These are component speakers, meaning that they have the door woofer speakers that come with separate tweeters. This kit also come with crossovers
      which contain high pass filters for the tweeters and mid-to-low pass filters for the woofers. These in combination with the amp, produced crisp and 
      clear sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      As brilliant as these speakers were, they lacked sub-bass. To fix this, I needed a subwoofer. I wanted a subwoofer that woud produce clear and clean
      bass rather than powerful for a balanced sound system. I was also limited by the small interior of the MR2 with little space behind and under the seats.
      Note that this is a two door mid-engined car. This also meant that the trunk is behind the engine, so I can't place it there either. Doing some research
      for inspiration, I decided to have one behind the seat as that's where I had the most space. For optimal sound, subwoofers need an enclosure that is 
      proportional to the diameter. With larger diameter subs being more capable at delivering lower frequencies, bigger is better. There are also sealed or
      ported enclosures. Ported had more benefits for audio quality but took more space. There are also powered subs which have an inbuilt amplifier, but I had
      found a great amp great for the door speakers and sub. Luckily, I found another solution. Kicker produces subwoofers in professionally tuned encosures
      that are quite slim. After measuring, I found that the 8-inch model fit perfectly behind the car seat. Although this is a small diameter, this sub also
      features a passive radiator, which is just the diaphragm. This is basically another speaker without a motor driver. It simpy reacts to the changes in air
      pressure in the encosure to improve the bass response. I managed to also get a 4-ohm model for better quality (less volume).
    </p>    
    <h3>Amplifiers</h3>
    <p>Next was to research ampifiers. There are two common types of car audio amplifiers. Class D and Class A/B. Class A/B amplifiers 
      are an older design which can produce very high quality amplification. However, modern Class D amplifiers can do the same much more efficiently
      coming in much smaller sizes and producing less heat than a Class A/B of equal power rating. Another consideration to be made was that I would be 
      using low power inputs from my phone AUX or the stock 26 year old head unit. Thus my options were purchasing a pre-amp unit or an amp with 
      speaker-level input. I decided to choose speaker-level input, which just take the old output to speaker cables as input. This was a much more
      affordable for me as a Uni student, though I might switch to a phone pre-amp in the future.

      To drive the speakers, I had to first consider the number of channels. The door speakers plus tweeters, take two channels (left and right), the rear
      speakers also take two channels (left and right) and I decuded to bridge two channels for the subwoofer, as speakers for lower frequencies draw more 
      power. This is because the lower frequencies move less volume of air in the same time. Thus, they require larger diameter speaker diaphragms to move
      a greater volume of air. This requires a larger motor driver which draws more power. Thus I decided to get one 4-channel amp for the door speakers 
      and the sub, and a lower power 2-channel amp for the small rear speakers. I found a class-D 1200W Pioneer amplifier as these were capable of supplying
      slightly more RMS power and peak power to the door speakers than they are rated, to maximise the use of them. They also were capable of bridging 2-channels
      for the sub-woofer and also came with a bass-level adjuster knob. It also had the option to switch to a low-pass filter. I found a tiny motorbike amp for
      the rear speakers which was also class D. Both amps were capable of speaker-level input.
