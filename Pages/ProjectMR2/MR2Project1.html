    <p>This was one of the first mods I made to this car, as I am a audio fanatic. In this page, I will rundown the 
      design process, the parts I used and the installation.
    </p>
    <h2>Design Process</h2>
    <p>My requirements for the sound system was to have:
      <ul>
        <li>balanced and clear audio throughout audible frequency range</li>
        <li>require minimal modification to maintain stock look</li>
        <li>Use the stock head unit</li>
        <li>Have AUX and/or Buetooth functionality</li>
       </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
       The first step was to determine all the speaker positions and sizes. I found a 
       <a href="https://www.mr2oc.com/threads/stock-speaker-sizes-locations-pin-outs-and-harness-p-ns.180/">forum</a>
       which stated that the front door speakers were 5 1/4 inch but could fit some 6 1/2 inch speakers and the rear speakers were 3 1/2 inch. 
       The doors also have tweeters mounted on close to the side-view mirrors.
      </p>
      <p>Next was to research ampifiers. There are two common types of car audio amplifiers. Class D and Class A/B. Class A/B amplifiers 
      are an older design which can produce very high quality amplification. However, modern Class D amplifiers can do the same much more efficiently
      coming in much smaller sizes and producing less heat than a Class A/B of equal power rating. Another consideration to be made was that I would be 
      using low power inputs from my phone AUX or the stock 26 year old head unit. Thus my options were purchasing a pre-amp unit or an amp with 
      speaker-level input. I decided to choose speaker-level input, which just take the old output to speaker cables as input. This was a much more
      affordable for me as a Uni student, though I might switch to a phone pre-amp in the future.
