    <p>In 2020, I decided that I would like to build a drones. During my research, I came across the FPV Drone community,
      consisting of many hobbyists collaborating and making first person view racing, freestyle and cinematography quadcopters.
      I made two drones, one for freestyle and one for cinematography. The freestyle drone had 5 inch proppellers,
      higher voltage battery, and larger motors, for high speed flying. The second has smaller motors and airducts that improve
      thrust efficiency and protection so that the spinning propellors don't damage property or injure people featured in the videos.
