    <p>The Toyota MR2 SW20 was one of my dream cars, and so in 2021 I finally bought one.
      My intention for this car was to be a weekender car that I could also use as a learning
      platform. I can learn about the different mechanical functions while also making my own 
      projects for modernising the car while maintaining the retro style
