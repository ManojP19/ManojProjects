    <p>This project is basically a group of little projects aimed at modernising my currently ancient room. All of these will be controlled on a tablet interface
      This includes: <br>    - A height adjustable bedside table (in the works)<br>    - dimmable light with clap on<br>    - automatic blinds<br>    - Tablet GUI<br>  
        - Gesture control with computer vision<br>    - more when I think of them
